<h1>All About Me</h1>
    <p>
        My name is Wesley and I am 17. Some of my interests and hobbies are I like to play video games, watch TV, read, learn interesting
        facts, play trading card games, code, and bike/mountain bike. One of the goals of this year for my other classes is get better at proof reading
        and not being too wordy in explnations. For this class I want to learn a lot in computer science and learn different coding languages. The 
        style of tv shows I like is Anime. What I like to listen to for music is hard rock/metal(incuding the subsets of the metal genre).
